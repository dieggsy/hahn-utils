* TODO Optional descriptions for examples?
* TODO Versions
  Parse =*.release-info= to get the versions; look up said tags for
  git, svn, hg, &c.
* TODO Find a canonical egg to imitate.
  Or, just do a survey for how to handle e.g. dependencies, versions.
* TODO Pull things out of the metafile.
  See [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/Metafile%2520reference][here]]; includes:

  - Synopsis
  - Author
  - Maintainer
  - Files
  - License
  - Category
  - Needs
    - Why not include a link, too?
  - Depends
  - Test-depends
  - Hidden
  - Platform
  - Foreign-depends

  Too bad we can’t get the name of the egg from the =.meta=; what
  about the name of the metafile itself?

  Can we do away with the cock-preamble altogether? User and email
  might be tricky.
* TODO Need version history and license
  See [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/http-session][http-session]], for example; can take the version history from
  the git-tags? Assumes that we’re in a git repo.

  License is simply part of the metadata; maybe we should get it from
  the [[egg]], after all.
* TODO Get metadata from egg.
# <<egg>>
  Authors, License, &c.
* TODO Add the ability to do generic procedures not associated with code.
  E.g. just a naked =@(procedure for-instance "For instance" (x
  "This") (y "That"))=.
* TODO Add the ability to document e.g. constructors in records.
* TODO Add a =@nosource= directive.
* TODO Find some way to demarcate the source-block.
* TODO Still getting segfaults on eval
* TODO Clearly demarcate source code.
  I keep thinking it's an example but end up getting clowned.
* TODO Things like =@example-no-eval= should be done with flags.
* TODO Formalize =@noop=.
* TODO Bring "Examples" down to the lowest heading.
* TODO Doubling up functions
  See e.g. [[http://api.call-cc.org/doc/posix#def:call-with-output-pipe][call-with-{input,output}-pipe]]. Groups of functions; another
  example is [[http://api.call-cc.org/doc/scsh-process][scsh-process]].

  Could have a simple =(@group <function>)= command.
* TODO Inherit unspecified parameters from other procedures.
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define (foo bar)
      @("For reals"
        (bar (@inherit baz [qux]))))
    
    (define (baz qux)
      @("Sort of"
        (qux "Yes, wirklich")))
  #+END_SRC
* TODO =setup-helper=-like-thing we can call from setup.
# <<setup-helper>>
  Would define a form =cock= on analogy with e.g. =compile=;
  basically, a wrapper around =run=. Has options like: =output:=; if
  given no files, picks up all =.scm= in the directory?

  Would be nice if it could default to e.g. =<egg-name>.wiki=.
* TODO Groff output for man-pages?
  This is usually bin-specific, though; we'd put directives in the
  bin-file, then, wouldn't we: and couldn't we parse =args= while
  we're at it?
* TODO HTML driver
  An HTML driver is useful, unfortunately, for e.g. github-pages.
* TODO Changelog
* TODO Repository
* TODO =pre-post-order=
  A better mechanism would be to transform the code into some
  intermediate S-expression representation; that way, each driver is
  simply a ruleset.
* TODO Markup
  Instead of using strings (which will be given verbatim), can't we
  have some sort of ad-hoc s-expression-based markup? E.g.:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    @(This is (em some) (_ markup).
      (arg "Argument"))
  #+END_SRC

  Meh; we have no good way to differentiate argument lists. Fuck it:
  let's go [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/lowdown][markdown]].

  (See the defunct [[https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/multidoc][multidoc]], by the way.)

  It's going to be a pain-in-the-ass to distinguish between intra- and
  inter-document links, isn't it? How I wish I could defer to the
  renderer.
